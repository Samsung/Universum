Create dummy project
--------------------

If you have Universum installed via ``pip3.7 install -U universum`` or downloaded it from GitHub and changed
working directory to project root, run ``python3.7 -m universum init`` to create an example source directory
with example config and get a command to run it.

Afterwards replace ``universum_dummy_project`` with actual project sources, and edit ``universum_config.py``
doc:`according to your project needs <configuring>`.
