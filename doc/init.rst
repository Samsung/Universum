Create dummy project
--------------------

After installing Universum via ``pip3.7 install -U universum`` or simply from a downloaded project root directory
run ``python3.7 -m universum init`` to create an example source directory with example config and get a command
to run it.

After doing so replace ``universum_dummy_project`` with actual project sources, and edit ``universum_config.py``
doc:`according to your project needs <configuring>`.
