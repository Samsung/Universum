Initialize Universum
--------------------

If you have Universum installed via ``{pip} install -U universum`` or downloaded it from GitHub and changed
working directory to project root, run ``{python} -m universum init`` to create an example configuration file,
that can be :doc:`updated according to your project needs <configuring>` later.

Running this command will not only create a configuration file, but will also provide you with a command line to
execute it with Universum.
