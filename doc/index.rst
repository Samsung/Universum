Project `Universum` is a continuous integration framework, containing
a collection of functions that simplify implementation of the
automatic build, testing, static analysis and other steps.
The goal of this project is to provide unified approach for adding continuous integration
to any project. It currently supports Perforce, Git, Gerrit, Swarm, Jenkins and TeamCity.

Sometimes `Universum` system can be referred to as the framework or just CI.
